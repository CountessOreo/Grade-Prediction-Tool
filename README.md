**BrightPath Academy Student Success Project**

 **About BrightPath Academy**
    
    Located in a bustling urban area, BrightPath Academy is a progressive secondary school. 
    The school encourages not only academic achievement but also extracurricular activity and personal development because it is dedicated to both academic excellence and holistic development.

  **Mission**
    
    To ensure that every learner achieves their full potential by empowering them via early academic interventions and individualized instruction.

  **BrightPath's Problems**
  
   The academy faces several significant obstacles in spite of their progressive stance:

    1.  Delayed Identification of At-Risk Students: Academically disadvantaged students are not promptly identified.
    2. Absence of Targeted Support: Tutoring and mentorship are examples of interventions that aren't customized to meet the requirements of specific students.
    3. Limited Extracurricular Activity Insights: Not enough information is available to assess the impact of extracurricular activity on academic performance.
    4. Data Overload: Teachers collect a lot of data, but they don't have a consolidated, actionable method to use when making judgments.

  **Problem Statement**
    
    BrightPath Academy is commited to academic and personal excellence, it however is struggling to proactively support students who may fall behind. 
    The system that is currently in use lacks a timely mechanism that identifies learners who are at risk, which leads to the failure of being able to identify oppurtunites for intervention.

    The interventions are also not unique and are more generic, which serves as a problem as different students will require different needs. The educators also do not have access to a tool that will allow them to process the large volumes of data. 

    This project aims to leverage machine learning to not only be able to predict students who are at risk, but to also uncover patterns that will provide personalized and effective support strategies for the students. 
    This will assist the academy to make data-driven decisions that will enhance the academic outcomes, optimize resource allocation and to improve the well-beng of the students.

  **Hypothesis**
  
Students with a higher absenteesim are predicted to have a much lower GPA than of students who have a lower absenteesim rate.
We hypothesize that for every increase in the number of absences, a student's GPA will decrease.
Additionally, students who have a higher study time are more likely to have a higher GPA despite being absent.
We also predict that the students with parental support and those who receive tutoring are more likely to have  higher GPA, even if they have a higher absenteesim rate, which suggests that the interventions of parents and tutoring are able to mitigate the negative effect that absenteesim has on the academic performance

  **Key Outcomes**
    
    1. Early detection of at-risk students
    2. Actionable insights for educators
    3. Understanding of how extracurriculars impact academic performance
    4. Centralized, intuitive dashboard for student success strategies
