**BrightPath Academy Student Success Project**

 **About BrightPath Academy**
    
    Located in a bustling urban area, BrightPath Academy is a progressive secondary school. 
    The school encourages not only academic achievement but also extracurricular activity and personal development because it is dedicated to both academic excellence and holistic development.

  **Mission**
    
    To ensure that every learner achieves their full potential by empowering them via early academic interventions and individualized instruction.

  **BrightPath's Problems**
  
   The academy faces several significant obstacles in spite of their progressive stance:

    Delayed Identification of At-Risk Students: Academically disadvantaged students are not promptly identified.
    
    Absence of Targeted Support: Tutoring and mentorship are examples of interventions that aren't customized to meet the requirements of specific students.
    
    Limited Extracurricular Activity Insights: Not enough information is available to assess the impact of extracurricular activity on academic performance.
    
    Data Overload: Teachers collect a lot of data, but they don't have a consolidated, actionable method to use when making judgments.

  **Problem Statement**
    
    Use machine learning to identify at-risk students early and provide specialized interventions.
